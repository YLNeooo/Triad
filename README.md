# Vision:

Taking inspiration from Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis, our app offers a sacred space for self-exploration and inner peace. Through intimate dialogue with AI Agents embodying the Ego and Superego, users are invited into a symbolic *roundtable of the mind* — an intimate yet private chit chat where thoughts, troubles, and desires are laid bare. In this triadic conversation, healing begins, clarity emerges, and the journey toward self-understanding unfolds.
